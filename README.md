Ontario School Ranking

Locating a good School is always a hard task, but there are plenty of sites with useful information, like the school ranking (http://ontario.compareschoolrankings.org/). However, I've found some issues with the system, and wanted to run some analytics on the data collected from this site. Also. I found various problems related to the School Addresses, and their location in the map used by the ranking site. For this reason, I'm building (still ongoing) a system that allows me an easy interaction with the region map (using google maps), and run analytics on this data.
